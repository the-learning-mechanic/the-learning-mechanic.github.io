# About

Thank you for stopping by. This blog is my way of documenting my journey
through the second semester of part 2 of the [FastAI: Machine Learning
for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)

I’ve had a successful career as a product leader and owner at amazing
companies like Microsoft, Blackberry, and Lucent. I hold a bachelor’s in
Physics and a Master’s in Computer Science. Some of my more notable
accomplishments were the first to launch a Garmin GPS-integrated
smartphone; the 3600 Curve from Blackberry and the first to launch the
920 Lumia Windows Phone with Microsoft. I’ve had the privilege of
supporting product, technical sales and business operations teams
leading software and hardware launches. My interest in machine learning
started from working with numpy, pandas, and SQLAlchemy as a Developer
Evangelist Lead at a Geo-Spatial and Analytics company. My curiosity led
me to the courses at FastAI where after a couple of false starts I
joined a study group as a way to learn and interact with others who
share a similar interest in machine learning. The combination of my
fondness for linear algebra and diff equations, accessibility of Python
as a language, and last three years working as a Developer Evangelist at
a GeoSpatial and Analytics Company is what motivated me to go through
the FastAI course.
